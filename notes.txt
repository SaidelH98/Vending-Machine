1) Make sure that if an item is out of stock it should say SOLD OUT instead of 0 items remaining
2) Feed money should be adding money, if there is 8.75, if I feed $10 it should say 18.75 not 10
3) Maybe add a way to exit from select product if the customer declines buying?
4) Add log.txt
5) Make Sales Report
6) Fix feed money bug when user inputs too many decimals
7) Fix bug when you try to purchase an item with no money in the machine
